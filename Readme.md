## Introduction
According to the survey of WHO around 1.25Million people get injured and killed due to road accident. And this number is increasing day by day. 

Whenever we talk about any accident only 2-3 factors are come into our mind like 

Either the speed of vehicle is very high | Either the driver is not professional | Either the driver is drunk

But in reality, there are some other factors which also plays major role in any accident like No of Passenger | Vehicle Type | Road Type | Weather Condition etc.
This Project is based upon supervised machine learning which will going to predict the risk-level of your accident.
Level-0 i.e LOW level-1 HIGH level-2 Very HIGH

This project follows SEMMA MODEL Methodology to predict the zone. SEMMA stands for SAMPLE, EXPLORE, MODIFY, MODEL, ACCESS.

I have dataset of 2500+ accident their causes which plays a role for that particular accident on the basis of this dataset my system will predict the zone with 95% accuracy. This is the Phase-01 of my project in which basically user have to give all the factors manually after that my ML model will predict the zone.
